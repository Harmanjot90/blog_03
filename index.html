            <p>Observability is increasingly important to modern IT operations because it enables proactive collection, aggregation, and correlation of information about applications running on cloud infrastructure. It is no longer sufficient for organizations to use dashboards to monitor system performance or to view operational performance solely through point tools such as application performance monitoring or log management.

            <p>There’s always something sitting between people and the world around them. Whether it’s a tool, a story, a brand, or a person, external factors influence what they think, how they interact, and the way they feel as they move through life.

                These trends explore the evolution of these factors—because it’s putting society into a state of flux. People are now deconstructing everything as they try to figure out who they are in the world.
                
                New intelligence layers are emerging in digital interactions, while people are examining the consequences of past experiences. The harmony between people, technology and business is showing tensions.</p>

            <p>Companies that are considering adopting a particular technology typically base the decision on the strength of the business case. Such an assessment is straightforward when the technology will upgrade existing equipment or replace manual processes with automation, or when the technology is already in use at other organizations that have demonstrated its benefits. But it’s much harder to quantify the value of emerging technologies that are not yet being widely used.
